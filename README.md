## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Serial entrepreneur. 3+ years of hands-on experience developing a product/platform from scratch. For me, any or every code written (even test code) must be optimised for formatting, standard, performance, reusability and scalability (I know it's too much). I enforce this in day to day development.

I'm a developer from the core, so continuous learning is something that I never miss. My playground:

- Design & develop complex yet user-friendly applications
- Find solutions to complex & challenging problems
- Peer review my team's code and spot things without running
- Share my knowledge (it doesn't matter if they are a fresher)
- Contribute to open source community
